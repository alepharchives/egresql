Egresql
=======
Author: Erik Søe Sørensen

Egresql will be SQL server written in Erlang.
It uses the HanoiDB storage backend, and the PostgresQL wire protocol
for client-server communication.

Status
------
The project is at its very infancy.
A PostgresQL client can connect to the server and issue queries.
Not much else works at the moment.
